Medi Talk app.

A Comprehensive Solution
Recognizing these challenges, MediTalk steps forward as a comprehensive solution to address these issues and provide a seamless healthcare experience. It allows holders of Hungarian Social Security cards (further referred to as patients) to have a personalized AI chatbot to discuss any medical concerns, without having any social anxiety or shyness. The patient would write their concerns to the chatbot which will ask specifying questions to narrow down the possible causes. The AI is provided with the patient's history of medical records which allows the chatbot to detect false concerns (e.g. hypochondria, cyberchondria, mild headache from dehydration) from valid ones more precisely.
